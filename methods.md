# Methods & Evidence Interpretation in Critical Care Trials

## Key Concepts
- Intention-to-treat analysis
- Composite endpoints in ICU trials
- Time-to-event outcomes and censoring
- Fragility index and trial robustness

## Common Challenges
- Heterogeneous ICU populations
- Evolving standards of care
- Mortality as an insensitive endpoint
- Protocol adherence in critically ill patients

## Interpretation Principles
- Contextualize results within contemporaneous care
- Avoid extrapolation beyond trial populations
- Emphasize absolute risk differences
